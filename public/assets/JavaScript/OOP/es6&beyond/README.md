## `Var`, `Let`, `Const`

### Var

The scope of var is global when it is declared outside a function. This means that any variable that is declared outside a function block is available for use in the whole window

var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is available and can be accessed only within that function



```js
 var iamGlobal = "This is global variable."

 function myFun(){
    var iamLocal = "This function scoped and is only accessible within the function"
 }


```
The code snippet above will redeclare the value of iamGlobal

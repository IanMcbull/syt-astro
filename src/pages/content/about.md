# SpaceYaTech Mentorship

The program is designed to be flexible and is tailored to meet the needs of developers. Our first cohort will focus on Web Development and targets developers looking to learn JavaScript, CSS and HTML.


We will be opening up other cohorts in the near future that will also cater to individuals looking to get mentorship in other fields like Data Science, Mobile Development and so fourth. So keep an eye out for that and give a follow on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SpaceYaTech) page.
